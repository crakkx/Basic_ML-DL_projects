# üê±üê∂ Cats vs Dogs Classifier (92% Accuracy)

This project classifies images of cats and dogs using a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and OpenCV.

Achieved **~92% validation accuracy** on the [Kaggle Dogs vs Cats dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats).

##  Features

- CNN architecture built with TensorFlow Keras
- Preprocessing using OpenCV
- Visualization with Matplotlib
- Web interface using Streamlit
- Trained on Kaggle Cats vs Dogs dataset

## App Demo
